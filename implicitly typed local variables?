An implicitly typed local variable is created by using the var keyword followed by a variable initialization

The var keyword has an important use in C#. Many times, the type of a variable is obvious from its initialization. 
In those cases, it's simpler to use the var keyword. The var keyword can also be useful when planning the code for an application.
When you begin developing code for a task, you may not immediately know what data type to use. 
Using var can help you develop your solution more dynamically.

Example Program.

var firstName = "Saisharan"; //we have used String 
var employeeID = 1323; //we have used Integar value
var hisPercentage = 25.4m; // we have used Decimal 
var initialofemployee = 'S'; // we have used character.

Console.WriteLine(firstName);

Console.WriteLine(employeeID );
Console.WriteLine(hisPercentage);

output.
Saisharan
1323
25.4
S
